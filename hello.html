        <h2>Joe! Joe! Joe!</h2>
        <p>Well!!! Let's break out the tin foil hats cause Roman thinks there is a conspiracy.
        He didn't just beat you, he exposed you! You kept on saying you were the only one who could beat the Beast.
        And you failed, which makes you a failure.
        It also makes you a liar, you lied to your friends, fans, and your family.
        Every time you fight the beast you get messed up.
        You get broken and the beast gets richer.
        And no matter how many times we tell this story, in the same outcome, you lose.
        After the beast rag dolls you again, I'll be here to put you to sleep.
        It's time! For your main event.

        <p> Get good! </p>
